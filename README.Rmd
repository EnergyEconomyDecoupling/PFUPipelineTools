# PFUPipelineTools


## Statement of need

Several packages are involved in creating the CL-PFU database, and
several of those packages provide computational pipelines
for the database. 
Those pipelines need access to common functions, say
for releasing (saving) computational targets to their respective pins, 
for reading targets from their pins, 
for filtering by countries and years, or
removing target groupings.

This package (`PFUPipelineTools`) addresses that need,
providing a single package for several functions
that are used across various CL-PFU database pipelines.


## Installation

You can install the development version of `PFUPipelineTools` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EnergyEconomyDecoupling/PFUPipelineTools")
```
