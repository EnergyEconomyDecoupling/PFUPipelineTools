\arguments{
\item{.df}{The data frame to be stored in the database.}

\item{table_name}{The name of the table in which \code{.df} will be stored.}

\item{hash_group_cols}{The columns by which \code{.df} will be grouped
before making the hash column.
Default is \code{NULL}, meaning that grouping will be
done on all columns that contain only 1 unique value.
See details.}

\item{.table_name_col}{The name of the column of the output that contains \code{table_name} on output.
Default is \code{PFUPipelineTools::hashed_table_colnames$db_table_name}.}

\item{.nested_col}{The name of the column of the output that contains
nested data.
Default is \code{PFUPipelineTools::hashed_table_colnames$nested_col_name}.}

\item{.nested_hash_col}{The name of the column of the output that contains
the hash of nested columns.
Default is \code{PFUPipelineTools::hashed_table_colnames$nested_hash_col_name}.}

\item{.algo}{The algorithm for hashing.
Default is "md5".}
}
\value{
A modified version of \code{.df} without groups. See details.

\description{
In the CL-PFU database pipeline,
we need the ability to download a
data frame from the database
based on a hash of the data.
This function calculates the appropriate hash.
}
\details{
The hash has two requirements:
\itemize{
\item values change when content changes and
\item provides sufficient information to retrieve the real data frame.
}

The uploaded data frames may be created by
grouped calculations,
so some columns are likely to have only one unique value.
We need to retain data of those single-valued columns
as well as the name of the database table.

To meet those requirements,
the return value from this function
has the following characteristics:
\itemize{
\item The first column (named with the value of \code{.table_name_col})
contains the value of \code{table_name}, the name
of the database table where \code{.df} is stored.
\item The second through N-1 columns are those specified by
\code{hash_group_cols} when \code{hash_group_cols} is not \code{NULL} (the default) or
or columns with only one unique value
(when \code{hash_group_cols} is \code{NULL}, the default).
\item The Nth column (named with the value of \code{.nested_col})
contains a hash of a data frame created by nesting
by \code{hash_group_cols} or by
all columns with more than one unique value
(when \code{hash_group_cols} is \code{NULL}).
}

The return value serves as a "ticket" with which
data can be retrieved from the database at a later time.
When data are withdrawn from the database,
the first column can be removed, and
the other columns with one unique value
can be used to filter \code{table_name}.
}
