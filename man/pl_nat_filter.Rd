\title{Filter a table from the database with natural expressions}
\usage{
pl_nat_filter(
  db_table_name,
  ...,
  conn,
  collect = FALSE,
  schema = schema_from_conn(conn = conn),
  fk_parent_tables = get_all_fk_tables(conn = conn, schema = schema)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db_table_name}{The string name of a database table.}

\item{...}{Natural filtering commands, such as would be applied
in the \code{...} argument of \code{dplyr::filter()}.}

\item{conn}{The database connection.}

\item{collect}{A boolean that tells whether to download the result.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{schema}{The data model (\code{dm} object) for the database in \code{conn}.
Default is \code{schema_from_conn(conn = conn)}.
See details.}

\item{fk_parent_tables}{A named list of all parent tables
for the foreign keys in \code{db_table_name}.
Default is
\code{get_all_fk_tables(conn = conn, schema = schema)}.
See details.}
}
\value{
A data frame downloaded from \code{conn},
a filtered version of \code{db_table_name}.
}
\description{
Often when collecting data from the database,
filtering is desired.
But filtering based on foreign keys is effectively impossible,
because of their encoding.
This function filters based on fk values,
not fk keys (typically integers),
thereby simplifying the filtering process.
By default, a \code{tbl} is returned.
Use \code{dplyr::collect()} to execute the resulting SQL query
and obtain an in-memory data frame.
Or, set \code{collect = TRUE} to execute the SQL and
return an in-memory data frame.
}
\details{
\code{schema} is a data model (\code{dm} object) for the CL-PFU database.
It can be obtained from calling \code{schema_from_conn()}.
If minimal interaction with the database is desired,
be sure to override the default value for \code{schema}
by supplying a pre-computed \code{dm} object.

\code{fk_parent_tables} is a named list of tables,
some of which are fk parent tables containing
the mapping between fk values (usually strings)
and fk keys (usually integers)
for \code{db_table_name}.
\code{fk_parent_tables} is treated as a store from which foreign key tables
are retrieved by name when needed.
An appropriate value for \code{fk_parent_tables} can be obtained
from \code{get_all_fk_tables()}.
If minimal interaction with the database is desired,
be sure to override the default value for \code{fk_parent_tables}
by supplying a pre-computed named list of
foreign key tables.
