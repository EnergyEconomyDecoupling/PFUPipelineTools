\title{Get a named list of foreign key tables}
\usage{
get_all_fk_tables(conn, schema = schema_from_conn(conn), collect = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn}{A connection to a database.}

\item{schema}{The data model (\code{dm} object) for the database in \code{conn}.
Default calls \code{schema_from_conn()}.
See details.}

\item{collect}{A boolean that tells whether to
download the foreign key tables.
Default is \code{FALSE} to enable
inboard processing of queries.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames,
where each data frame
is a table in \code{conn} that contains
foreign keys and their values.
}
\description{
For a database whose tables have many foreign keys
that point to primary key tables,
it is helpful to have a list of those foreign key tables
for inboard and outboard processing purposes,
especially when converting strings to integer keys.
This function extracts a named list of data frames,
where each data frame is a foreign key table in the database.
The data frame items in the list are named
by the names of the tables in the database at \code{conn}.
}
\details{
By default, the returned list contains \code{tbl} objects,
with references to the actual tables in \code{conn}.
To return the actual data frames, set \code{collect} to \code{TRUE}.

\code{schema} is a data model (\code{dm} object) for the database in \code{conn}.
Its default value (which calls \code{schema_fom_conn()})
extracts the data model for the database at \code{conn} automatically.
However, if the caller already has the data model,
supplying it in the \code{schema} argument will save some time.
